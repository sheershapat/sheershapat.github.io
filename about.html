                        Hi, my name is Sheersha Pattanaik. I am a freshman at Citrus Valley High School. I have many hobbies such as, playing violin, playing tennis, and reading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope to pursue Computer Science at college in the future and I am excited to learn more about the subject throughout the next few years!
